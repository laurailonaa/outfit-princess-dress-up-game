# Outfit Princess! - An Interactive Dress-Up Game Experience

## Description

Outfit Princess! is a simple, web-based app where users can dress-up an avatar and mix and match different clothing pieces!
The project is built with React, Node.js and SQLite database structure. The style of the app and digitally hand-drawn clothes
are inspired by 2000s dress-up games and aesthetics.
